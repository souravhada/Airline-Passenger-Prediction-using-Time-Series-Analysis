# Time Series Analysis of Airline Passenger Data

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Airline Passenger dataset, focusing on time series forecasting using SARIMA and ARIMA models. The objective is to model and forecast future passenger numbers and to evaluate the performance of these models in handling seasonal data.

## Project Overview

The Airline Passenger dataset showcases clear seasonal trends and non-linear growth in passenger numbers over time. This project explores the effectiveness of SARIMA and ARIMA models in forecasting these numbers, with a special focus on how well they capture seasonality.


## Models Used

**SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Suitable for datasets with seasonality, SARIMA is used to model the seasonal aspects effectively.
**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Tested for comparative purposes to highlight its limitations in handling seasonal data.

## Key Findings
**SARIMA's Effectiveness:** SARIMA significantly outperforms ARIMA in forecasting airline passenger numbers due to its ability to model the seasonal variations inherent in the data.
**Limitations of ARIMA:** ARIMA lacks the capability to handle the seasonality, which is evident from the comparative analysis with SARIMA.
